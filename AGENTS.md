# Aaris Unity CI agent instructions

Repository: sundamunda289-art/Unity-Game-Aris; branch: main. Public repository: NEVER commit or release passwords, tokens, Unity license files, Hub state, private content or secrets.

## Canonical world
Unity 6000.3.26f1, URP 17.3.0. Native source scene: Assets/TerrainDemoScene_URP/Scenes/TerrainDemoScene.unity; 2km by 2km world on four real TerrainData tiles. See Docs/MAP_LAYOUT.json, README.md, the existing AarisExplorerBuild.cs and Tools/Validation before edits. Many assets are Git LFS tracked: a pointer is NOT a valid Unity scene. A Release checkpoint does not replace permanent Git history.

## GitHub Actions only; no Codespaces
- Primary workflow: .github/workflows/aaris-unity-photographer.yml. Main branch pushes trigger it. workflow_dispatch accepts intent=all, houses, roads, tiles or sky.
- Unity executes Aaris.MapReview.Editor.AarisCICapture.Capture. It opens the checked-in native scene and captures genuine HD PNGs. No -nographics; Xvfb plus Mesa and a real graphics device required.
- Photos and photo-audit.json are uploaded to Actions artifacts and live-photos Release. Black/white/flat images are diagnosed; no success claim for unverified visuals.
- Cache release tags: engine-cache for the compatible Library, project-checkpoint for changed project assets. Archives are SHA-256 verified and individual assets are kept under 2 GiB.
- Never publish credentials, license folders or the Git working database. Library is an expendable import cache, not a source-of-truth snapshot.
- Jobs are ephemeral and limited to 6h maximum. Periodic saves plus if: always() are best-effort; hard termination/cancellation can bypass final cleanup. Persist final project changes in Git.
- CI cannot be a permanently reachable interactive Unity Editor screen. It can automate Editor operations with intent commands; no exposed VNC server or Codespace needed.
- Reproducible cold starts depend on Docker image availability, license, LFS access, disk, cache and network; 1-2 minutes is not guaranteed.
- Do not overwrite real terrain, mesh, scene, prefab, material or .meta files just to make screenshots pass. Capture errors require investigation.
- Test Python checkpoint with: python Tools/CI/session_store.py selftest. Treat Unity activation as a separate required dependency; only use configured GitHub Secrets, never print them.

## 2026-11-06: Separate production pipelines (authoritative)
- **Python (always license-free):** .github/workflows/python-map-operations.yml runs blueprint auditing on relevant pushes; workflow_dispatch supports audit, inspect and review-only material sync. It never blocks on Unity credentials. Source checker: Tools/CI/map_static_check.py. Its PASS is a data/geometry consistency result, not proof that URP renders correctly.
- **Rendering (requires valid license):** .github/workflows/aaris-unity-photographer.yml probes UNITY_LICENSE in a masked step. Missing license SKIPS the expensive photo job while its preflight remains green. UNITY_EMAIL and UNITY_PASSWORD may enable the optional GameCI activation action; these are Unity ID credentials, never Gmail credentials. A ULF from an authorized activation remains essential for Personal.
- **Security:** Never publish .ulf, OAuth tokens, service-account keys, Google credentials or any credential to a public GitHub Release, artifact, cache, Git commit, or logs. No spoofed machine IDs or unapproved automation of licensing.
- **Ops reference:** Docs/UNITY_CI_SECRETS.md contains the three Secrets, mobile setup, limitations and verification links. The Unity CLI service-account flow does not activate Unity Personal; no guaranteed perpetual login on ephemeral hosted runners.

## License-free visual fallback
- Workflow `.github/workflows/python-map-operations.yml` generates five 1920x1080 coordinate-accurate **schematic** map review PNGs from `Docs/MAP_LAYOUT.json` on relevant pushes and dispatches.
- Download from `https://github.com/sundamunda289-art/Unity-Game-Aris/releases/tag/layout-review` or the Actions artifact. Each diagram is labelled **NOT A UNITY RENDER**; never interpret these as evidence that Unity houses, skybox, colors, trees or URP shaders render correctly.
- The schematic workflow stays independent of Unity login, GameCI, `.ulf` files and runner identity. Its outputs can be regenerated on any fresh runner.

## Cloudflare email-protected live Unity session
- Workflow: .github/workflows/aaris-live-unity.yml starts on-demand Xvfb + noVNC through a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel restricted with --allowed-mail, using the UNITY_EMAIL GitHub Secret.
- Local Python camera API: Tools/CI/live_camera_server.py. Editor-only bridge: Assets/AarisWorld/Editor/AarisLiveCameraBridge.cs. Numeric requests cannot execute shell commands or save scene assets.
- No valid UNITY_LICENSE means an accessible Linux desktop, not a functioning Unity Editor. Unity Personal can require interactive Unity Hub activation on a fresh machine.
- Phone guide: Docs/UNITY_LIVE_CLOUDFLARE.md. Quick Tunnel sessions are temporary and cannot supply persistent cloud computing or a stable hostname.

## Free Cloudflare camera hub / GitHub Issue commands
- Persistent read-only Cloudflare hub: https://aaris-unity-live-hub.aaris-game-control-6f9c.workers.dev
- Camera control GitHub issue #77: https://github.com/sundamunda289-art/Unity-Game-Aris/issues/77
- While an explicit live GitHub Actions session runs, Tools/CI/issue_camera_bridge.py polls for CAMERA x y z yaw pitch distance comments from repository owner sundamunda289-art only. It can upload actual Editor PNGs to the public live-photos Release, and responds with immutable PNG links.
- Cloudflare hub has no KV/R2 writes and no paid components. It cannot run Unity; GitHub Actions hosts the temporary desktop. Live view requires email PIN; Unity Editor itself needs authorized Unity licensing.
- ChatGPT can request and read snapshots via the GitHub connector, but cannot receive a continuously streaming video in this chat. See Docs/UNITY_LIVE_CLOUDFLARE.md.


## Verified intent-driven control and license boundary
- Post START_DESKTOP 15, START_DESKTOP 45, or START_DESKTOP 90 as the
  sundamunda289-art repo owner on GitHub Issue #77; ChatGPT with the linked
  GitHub app can post this owner-authorized command. It triggers a temporary
  GitHub Actions desktop without running any phone commands.
- The runner advertises its PIN-protected temporary Cloudflare Tunnel URL in
  a bot issue comment; the stable free Cloudflare Worker hub discovers it.
- Post CAMERA x y z yaw pitch distance on the same issue. The runner polls
  and responds with an actual Unity PNG link only after successful Editor
  camera rendering; otherwise it returns a clear error.
- Test run 42239962330 confirmed start/issue relay; camera request 6688056483
  returned a license-not-available timeout. Real Unity render remains BLOCKED.
- Do not infer that the live desktop is Unity itself without valid activation.

## Fresh-runner Unity Personal activation attempt (2026-11-06)
- Authorized bootstrap: Tools/CI/unity_personal_bootstrap.py. The live workflow uses the pinned GameCI container and tries a legitimately issued UNITY_LICENSE ULF, or official Unity CLI OAuth login followed by "unity license activate --personal --accept-eula --non-interactive", then the actual GUI Unity Editor and initial camera framing.
- For any OAuth request, the one-time Unity sign-in URL is stored only in ci-live-control/license-status.json inside the ephemeral runner, served on the protected Cloudflare noVNC page via /api/license, and never posted publicly or archived. The user may need to approve via phone each new runner. Unity Cloud service accounts and passwords do NOT automatically activate Personal.
- Only sanitized, predefined license states can be reported to GitHub issue #77; OAuth URLs and passwords are never included. The stable Cloudflare Worker hub displays those states.
- Restore only Unity Library import cache with actions/cache@v4; this cache must not contain the license, Hub OAuth state, cookies or other credentials. A cold Docker pull and Git LFS hydration still cost time.
- The CLI path is a documented activation attempt, not a proven entitlement for a new runner. Official Unity 6000.3 Personal docs say Hub sign-in is the supported activation method. Failure is signaled, not bypassed. Do not spoof Machine IDs or fake screenshots.


## Assistant-triggered license retry (owner-only, no keyboard on phone)

A connected GitHub assistant (authorized as repo owner sundamunda289-art)
can now post these exact commands on GitHub Issue #77:
- ACTIVATE_UNITY 15 — start a fresh 15-minute Actions desktop and attempt
  authorized Unity Personal activation (also 45 or 90).
- ACTIVATE_UNITY — retry the official Unity activation process inside the
  currently RUNNING pinned GameCI Unity container; do not replace its host.
- CAMERA -420 22 -210 0 20 22 — move camera if the real Editor is licensed.

The issue relay allows ACTIVATE_UNITY only for owner-authored comments;
it executes a constant, bounded Docker command, not arbitrary shell input.
The container remains alive after an unsuccessful activation so a retry can
be attempted without downloading the same Editor again in that session.

**Important**: An explicit ACTIVATE_UNITY command cannot bypass Unity's
license entitlement, browser sign-in or MFA requirements. It works without
the user's intervention only when a valid authorized ULF / active authorized
session is available in that new container. For Unity Personal, GameCI
documents one-time Hub activation -> ULF -> UNITY_LICENSE GitHub Secret.
There is no supported ALF-to-ULF Personal manual activation at present.
Unity Cloud Service Account credentials alone do not grant an Editor
Personal license. No machine identity spoofing or token caching is used.

Verified repo-level unit test for command handler and the workflow's
issue_comment path ran in GitHub Actions. An actual successful Unity
license activation and true scene PNG have NOT yet been verified.


## AI hands and eyes (2026-11-07)

**Start here:** Docs/AI_UNITY_AGENT.md is the current authoritative AI command
protocol for an existing licensed live Actions Editor. Read it before an edit.
Keep the existing world/scene build and camera/Cloudflare workflow intact.

- Main AI tool: Tools/CI/ai_unity_ops.py; Unity main-thread executor:
  Assets/AarisWorld/Editor/AarisLiveCameraBridge.cs.
- Public GitHub Issue #77 is an **owner-only, bounded intent** channel:
  issue comments START_DESKTOP 45 and AI {"action":"inspect",...}.
  AI JSON can only request inspect, outline, capture, move, scale,
  resize, explicitly opted-in shared-material tint or prefab part scale, or save.
- ALWAYS inspect target by name/location, read exact IDs and actual dimensions,
  then issue a small reversible change; inspect and photograph again.
  OUTLINE returns sampled 3D vertices + bounding corners, not full
  photogrammetry or guaranteed leaf-level detail. Native tree instance
  transforms and scene objects have different persistence semantics.
- All map modifications save to native scene/TerrainData/material assets and
  only commit to an AI run-specific Git LFS review branch on SAVE or on
  best-effort normal workflow shutdown. Review PR before merging to main.
  No direct main edits, arbitrary shell, untracked meta, secrets or auth
  artifacts may be committed.
- Unity Editor / real screenshot is **BLOCKED without authorized licensing**.
  Verify a live-desktop job, Editor license state, Unity console and real PNG.
  A successful syntax test, Docker/Cloudflare startup or black screen is NOT
  success. The live noVNC is for the phone, while ChatGPT reads discrete
  image/JSON reports through GitHub; it cannot watch a continuous stream.
- The runner and tunnel are ephemeral. Rehydrate Git LFS and safe Unity Library
  cache on each session; do not persist token/ULF/Hub state in public artifacts.
  Force termination may lose unsaved changes. Never promise a cold start
  or capture will complete within seconds.
- Tests: python3 Tools/CI/ai_unity_ops.py selftest and
  python3 Tools/CI/issue_camera_bridge.py --selftest. Also check CI runs
  and real Unity compilation before calling this feature production-ready.
